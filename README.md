As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

**Analysis: **

- This data visualization analyzes the trends in rider behavior and preferences for the summer of 2022 . The analysis shows that over the course of the three months, there were 292K riders in New York City and the percentage of ridership has grown by 34.9% during the summer. May demonstrated the highest rate of growth by 60%, which could explain the 25% increase in number of stations being used. Members are more likely to frequent Citibikes more  given the lower cost per ride, this is also a contributing factor to the increase of ridership during this month. 

- The map shows that the highest concentration of bikes are other methods of transportation such as train terminals and ferry docks. This is likely due to commuters traveling frequently between New York and Jersey City and corresponds with the peak biking hours of 5pm. From this, we would recommend ensuring the availability of bikes during heavy demands , which could imply higher costs of maintenance but will also ensure the ongoing popularity of these bikes.

- Our analysis further demonstrates that classic bikes are used in lower quantites than classic and electric bikes yet have higher duration. This can be attributed to the flexibility of docked bikes, where multiple users can use the same bike while knowing exactly where it's located while classic and electric bikes are dock-less and would require more quantities to be available to be used.
